# SenTenCE: A multi-sensor data compression framework using tensor decompositions for 
human activity classification
## Abstract:
In this paper, we introduce SenTenCE (Sensor-Tensor Compression Engine), a tensor decomposition based lossy data compression framework for on-phone Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor data. We show that this technique achieves impressive data compression ratios with acceptably low percent-root mean square distortion that in turn results in negligible change in the classification accuracy of the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based supervised human activity classifier that is trained with the compressed data instead of the raw uncompressed data.
